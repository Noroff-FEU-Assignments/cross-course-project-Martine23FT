    <h2>WEB SECURITY</h2>
    <hr size="1px" width="2100px">
    <p id="web-security-question">Web security refers to the protection of websites, web applications and web services from unautorized access, exploitation and theft. Web security is essential because websites often contain sensitive informaton, 
        including user credentials, payment information, personal data and confidential business information. Here are some steps to secure your website: </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        <ol><span>SANITIZATION OF DATA:</span> Sanitization of data is the process of removing any unwanted or potentially harmful data from user input, such as scripts, HTML tags or other special characters. The purpose is to prevent security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks, which occur when malicious codes are injected into a system trough user input.</ol>
        <ol><span>AUTHORIZATION & AUHENTICATION:</span> Authentication and authorization are two essential concepts in web security, and its important to make these difficult to compromise. This can be obtained by: 
            <ul>
            <li>Strong password policies: Encourage the users to choose strong passwords that include a mix of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, etc.</li>
            <li>Multifactor authenticaton: Implementing multifactor authenticaton that requires users to verify their identity trough multiple methods, such as biometrics, text message- or email verification.</li> 
            <li>Implementing secure protocols: Using secure authentication protocols such as OpenID Connect, which are designed to provide secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, can help prevent common web security vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Keeping software up-to-date: Regularly updating software, including authentication and authorization modules and plugins, can help ensure that known security vulnerabilities are patched and fixed.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <ol><span>USING A THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION</span> Make sure that the chosen third-party application is tested and trusted. Using a third-party application for website security provides website owners with access to advanced security solutions and expertise, cost-effective services, easy implementation, continuous monitoring, regular updates, and compliance with industry regulations and standards.</ol>
        <ol><span>DEPLOYMENT/CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION(CI/CD):</span> Can play a crucial role in web security by allowing security testing to be integrated into the development pipeline, enabling developers to catch security vulnerabilities early in the development process and fix them quickly, reducing the risk of deploying insecure code to production.</ol>
        <ol><span>CHOOSING WEBSITE HOST:</span> Look for a host who provides robust security features (firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention and malware scanning/removal) and performs regular server maintenance and updates to ensure that securyity vulnerabilities are patched and fixed.</ol>
        <ol><span>AUTOMATIC USER TIMEOUT:</span> With automatic user timeout, a user's session is automatically terminated after a period of inactivity, requiring the user to re-authenticate to regain access to their account. This is a common security measure that can help protect against unauthorized access to a user's account. </ol>
